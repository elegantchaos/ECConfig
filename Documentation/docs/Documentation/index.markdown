The ECConfig framework doesn't actually contain any code at the moment.

Instead, it's a standard place used to store some common files used by all
the other Elegant Chaos libraries.

This includes:

- [standard xcconfig files](xcconfigs)
- [standard precompiled header files](pch-files)
- [helper scripts for building](scripts)
