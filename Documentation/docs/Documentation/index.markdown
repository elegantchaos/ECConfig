The ECConfig framework doesn't actually contain any code at the moment.

Instead, it's a standard place used to store some common files used by all
the other Elegant Chaos libraries.

This includes:

- [standard xcconfig files](Standard XCConfigs)
- [standard precompiled header files](Standard PCH Files)
- [helper scripts for building](Standard%20Scripts)
