This framework doesn't actually contain any code at the moment.

Instead, it's a standard place used to store some common files used by all
the other Elegant Chaos libraries.

This includes:

- Standard XCConfigs
- Standard Prefixes
- Standard Scripts

All of these are arranged on the assumption that client projects will be organised to conform to a standard [pattern](Organisation). 

Arranging your own project to use this pattern isn't essential, but if you use a different one you may have to modify some examples accordingly.

See the programming guides in the online documentation for more information.
