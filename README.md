This framework doesn't actually contain any code at the moment.

Instead, it's a standard place used to store some common files used by all
the other Elegant Chaos libraries.

This includes:

- Standard XCConfigs
- Standard PCH Files
- Standard Scripts

See the programming guides in the online documentation for more information.
